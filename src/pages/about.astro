    <p>
      Kumusta! My name is Jericho P. Bantiquete. I have a bachelor's degree and
      have experience in web development, with a strong passion for software
      development. I am currently based in the Philippines, where I am building
      a product as a partner in a startup and also taking on freelance work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of technologies,
      including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJs, Angular, RxJS, Akita,
      Vue, Laravel, Livewire, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, Figma, Git,
      GitHub, and more. While some of these are not my primary areas of
      expertise, I have gained valuable experience using them in both freelance
      projects and industry roles. My current tech stack, where I find the most
      productivity and which I primarily use for my projects, includes Laravel
      with React and TypeScript, utilizing Inertia.js, shadcn and Tailwind CSS
      for styling. For the database, I typically use MySQL or SQLite. Overall,
      my stack revolves around the Laravel ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am continuously learning about data structures and
      algorithms. Additionally, I am exploring and expanding my knowledge in
      various technologies such as Golang, Astro, Remix, Python, and Java. As I
      continue to enhance my skills, I am particularly interested in learning
      more about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    </p>

      Outside of programming, I enjoy playing chess, learning music—especially
      guitar, reading books, and listening to podcasts. I’ve created a list of
      books I’ve read and those I plan to read in the future, which you can
      check out <a href="/book-list" class="text-indigo-500 underline">here</a>.
      I also love curating <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/user/bwbn9zmf30zbwy254iksud8lc/playlists"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-indigo-500 underline"
      >
        Spotify playlists
      </a>. Additionally, I have set up a <a
        href="/gallery"
        class="text-indigo-500 underline">gallery</a
      > with some photos, in case you're curious to see a bit more about me.
