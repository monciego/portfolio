    <p>
      I currently work as a partner and engineer at a startup, where I develop
      products. In addition to my startup work, I also take on freelance
      projects and I am in the process of planning my own startup venture. I am
      passionate about learning new things and improving my skills every day,
      and I am always seeking opportunities to expand my skills and expertise.
